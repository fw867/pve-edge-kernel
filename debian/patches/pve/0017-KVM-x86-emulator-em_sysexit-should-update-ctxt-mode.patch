Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: emulator: em_sysexit should update ctxt->mode

SYSEXIT is one of the instructions that can change the
processor mode, thus ctxt->mode should be updated after it.

Note that this is likely a benign bug, because the only problematic
mode change is from 32 bit to 64 bit which can lead to truncation of RIP,
and it is not possible to do with sysexit,
since sysexit running in 32 bit mode will be limited to 32 bit version.
