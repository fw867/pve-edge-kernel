Subject: [PATCH] KVM: x86: emulator: update the emulation mode after rsm

Update the emulation mode after RSM so that RIP will be correctly
written back, because the RSM instruction can switch the CPU mode from
32 bit (or less) to 64 bit.

This fixes a guest crash in case the #SMI is received while the guest
runs a code from an address > 32 bit.
